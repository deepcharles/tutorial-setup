## Requirements

This tutorial uses Python 3 (version 3.6 at least) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

You will also need several Python packages that are listed in this [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file.

### With `pip`
All packages can be installed using `pip install package_name`.

### With `conda`
Most packages should also be available through `conda`, however I have not verified it.
At least one package (`loadmydata`) is not available through `conda`.
To install it, run (within a conda environment) `conda install pip` then `pip install loadmydata`. (See [the conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#installing-non-conda-packages) for more information.)
